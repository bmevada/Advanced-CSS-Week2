#Week 2: Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## Implement a website for a developer, whom is a potential candidate

As a developer, I want to deploy a portfolio of work as examples for the potential employers to review and let them know I am open for a position. 
I want to showcase my core skills and talents to employers by having an effective portfolio which highlights my strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it.

## Description
    * As a successful candidate, I want the potential employer to view single webpage which will view several projects of deployed web applications which I have completed during bootcamp.
    * Single page which is optimised for any screen size.
    * As a developer, I want the webpage to be optimised to scale of 1.0.
    * As a developer, I want the landing page to have a header and footer.
    * As a developer, I want the header of the landing page to include my name.
    * As a developer, I want the landing page to have a link to: "About me", which will include a description of myself and the projects I have worked on.
    * As a developer, I want the landing page to have a link to: "Work", which will a allow the potential employer to view several projects I have completed.
    * As a developer, I want the landing page to have a link to: "Contact Me", which will provide information about on contact number and email address.
    * As a developer, I want the landing page to have a link to: "Resume" which will open up to my resume document.
    * As a developer I want the landing page to have a polished and accessible UI.

## Acceptance Criteria
These are the critical requirements which I want to develop which will potentially meet the needs of presenting a portfolio of various completed projects:
```
GIVEN that the potential employer will review several of my completed projects
WHEN the web page loads, I want the header to include my name and include semantic HTML elements which links to the section "about me"; "my work"; and how to "Contact Me"
WHEN the link is clicked on, the UI scrolls to the corresponding section of the webpage
WHEN the link to "About Me" is clicked on 
THEN the UI scrolls to the description of about me and the project
WHEN the link to "My Work" is clicked on 
THEN the UI scrolls to the to a section of tiled images of my projects
WHEN the tile of any given project is hovered over, it will provide a brief to the project
WHEN the image of project is clicked on
THEN the employer will be directed to the deployed application
WHEN the link to "Contact me" is clicked on 
THEN the UI scrolls to the bottom of the page, where my contact details will be viewed
WHEN the link to "Resume" is clicked on 
THEN the resume will open up
WHEN the webpage is resized or viewed on various screen sizes/devices
THEN the webapge will be presented with a responsive layout whihc adapts to the viewers viewport
